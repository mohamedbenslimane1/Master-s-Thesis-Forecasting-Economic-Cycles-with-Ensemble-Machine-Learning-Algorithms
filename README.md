Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and algorithms are one of the many tools for predicting economic cycles and anticipating real-time turning points in the U.S. economy. 
The variable of interest, called Y, is used to classify regimes as accelerating or decelerating. We highlight the numerous methods to perform this real-time prediction of the present by simulating
an expanding window during our estimates and by exploiting a database containing over 70 economic indicators as well as monthly turning points from 1985 to 2020 in the U.S. economy.

After comparing the accuracy and the ability of these algorithms to handle a large number of explanatory variables and to estimate data with numerous econometric tools, these theoretical 
results are then tested against the implementation of two hypothetical and deliberately simple investment strategies, the Equity and Dynamic strategies. Comparing these two strategies with
the classic benchmark strategy, known as 'Buy and Hold,' will determine the best investment choice based on economic cycles in the United States, to see if it is possible to beat the market 
using these algorithmic prediction tools.
